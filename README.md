# Graduate Admission Prediction
Welcome to my Admission Prediction Model project! This project aims to predict the likelihood of admission to a graduate program based on various parameters such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, statement of purpose strength, letters of recommendation, undergraduate GPA, and research experience. I developed this model using a linear regression algorithm trained on a dataset containing historical admission data. The model is exposed through a Plumber API endpoint, allowing users to make predictions by sending POST requests with the required input parameters. Additionally, the project includes scripts for model training, evaluation, and saving, ensuring easy reproducibility and scalability. Whether you're a student looking to gauge your chances of admission or an educator interested in predictive modeling, this project provides a valuable tool for understanding and predicting admission outcomes. I hope you find this project insightful and useful for your needs. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to its development, or integrate it into your own applications!
